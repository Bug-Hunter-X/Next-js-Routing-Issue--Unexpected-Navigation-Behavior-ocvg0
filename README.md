# Next.js Routing Issue: Unexpected Navigation Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with Next.js routing, specifically when using the `Link` component and the `useRouter` hook together for navigation between pages.

## Bug Description

The application consists of two pages: `Home` and `About`.  Navigating from `Home` to `About` using the `Link` component works correctly.  However, navigating back from `About` to `Home` using `useRouter.push()` might exhibit unexpected behavior such as incomplete page transitions, incorrect rendering, or the navigation not working altogether.  This inconsistency highlights a potential conflict or misconfiguration in the routing logic.

## Bug Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Click the "Go Back Home" button. Observe the potential discrepancies in the transition or rendering of the home page.

## Solution

The solution typically involves carefully reviewing the routing configuration, ensuring proper use of the `Link` component and `useRouter` hook, and checking for any conflicting routing rules or misconfigurations that might interfere with the expected navigation behavior.
